## How to fail at learning to Code

A person named "_Noob Programmer_"

- He didn't have a clear goal at the beginning of his journey
- He started by watching courses and reading tutorials, but he would just copy the code without caring how it works. Sometimes he would just copy and paste code!
- He didn't reinforce what he was learning by doing small challenges or taking notes He didn't practice coding, and didn't come up with his own project ideas
- He quickly became frustrated when his code was not perfectly clean or efficient He lost motivation because he thought he could never know everything
- He was learning in isolation
- After finishing a couple of a courses, he thought he now was a web developer and could start applying to jobs. But he couldn't even build an app on his own!

## How to succeed at learning to Code

- He didn’t have a clear goal at the beginning of his journey
	- **FIX**
		- Set a specific, measurable, realistic and time-based goal 
		- Know exactly why you are learning to code: Switching careers? Finding a better job?
		- Imagine a big project you want to be able to build!
		- Research technologies you need and then learn them
- He would just copy the code without caring how it works. Sometimes he would just copy and paste code!
	- **FIX**
		- Understand the code that you're studying and typing 
		- Always type the code, don't copy-paste!
- He didn't reinforce what he was learning by doing small challenges or taking notes
	- **FIX**
		- After you learn a new a feature or concept, use it immediately 
		- Take notes
		-  Challenge yourself and practice with small coding exercises and challenges
		- Don't be in a hurry to complete the course fast!
- He didn't practice coding, and didn't come up with his own project ideas
	- **FIX**
		- Practicing on your own is the most important thing to do
		- This is NOT optional! Without practice outside of courses, you won't go anywhere!
		- Come up with your own project ideas or copy popular sites or applications, or just parts of them in the beginning Don't be stuck in "tutorial hell"
- He quickly became frustrated when his code was not perfectly clean or efficient
	- **FIX**
		- Don't get stuck trying to write the perfect code!
		- Just write tons of code, no matter the quality!
		- Clean and efficient code will come with time
		- You can always refactor code later
- He lost motivation because he thought he could never know everything
	- **FIX**
		- Embrace the fact that you will never you know everything
		- Just focus on what you need to achieve your goal!
- He was learning in isolation 
	- **FIX**
		- Explain new concepts to other people. If you can explain it, you truly understand it!
		- Share your goals to make yourself accountable
		- Share your learning progress with the web dev community ( ##100DaysOfCode, ##CodeNewbie, ##webdev, etc.)
- After finishing a couple of courses, he thought he now was a web developer and could start applying to jobs 
	- **FIX**
		- The biggest misconception that people have!
		- Courses are an amazing starting point, but are only the beginning of your journey!

## Learning how to code is hard, but you can do it!

## How to fail at solving problems

WHENEVER JOHN ENCOUNTERS A PROBLEM:
* He jumps at the problem without much thinking 
*  He implements his solution in an unstructured way 
*  He gets stressed out when things don't work
* He is too proud to research solutions
- **FIX**
	- Stay calm and slow down, don't just jump at a problem without a plan
	-  Take a very logical and rational approach (programming is just logic, in the end...) 
	- Use my 4-step framework to solve any problem 
- Make sure you 100% understand the problem. Ask the right questions to get a clear picture of the problem
- Divide and conquer: Break a big problem into smaller sub-problems.
- Don't be afraid to do as much research as you have to
- For bigger problems, write pseudo-code before writing the actual code

## What is a software bug?

- Software bug: Defect or problem in a computer program. Basically, any unexpected or unintended behavior of a computer program is a software bug.
- Bugs are completely normal in software development!
- Debugging: Process of finding, fixing and preventing bugs.
- _Note_ - A real bug which was causing an error in Harvard's computer in the 1940s
